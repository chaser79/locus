# locus

Locus is a **Flutter plugin, not an application**: a background geolocation SDK with native
Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift) implementations behind a thin Dart facade. Host apps import only
`package:locus/locus.dart` — everything under `lib/src/` is an implementation detail and outside
the semver contract. Dependencies, executables, and the SDK version live in `pubspec.yaml`.

## Commands

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter analyze --fatal-infos --fatal-warnings    # CI treats infos and warnings as errors
dart format --set-exit-if-changed --output=none .
flutter test --coverage
dart run tool/sync_version.dart --check           # version pins in sync with pubspec

# Native lanes run from the example app, not from the plugin root
cd example/android && ./gradlew :locus:testDebugUnitTest :locus:lintDebug
cd example/android && ./gradlew :locus:connectedDebugAndroidTest   # needs a running emulator
swift test --package-path ios
bash tool/android_process_recovery_smoke.sh       # process-death recovery smoke

cd example && flutter run                         # the plugin has no runnable entry point
```

`.github/workflows/pipeline.yml` is the real gate: code quality, `pana` score threshold 130,
Android unit/lint/instrumentation on API 26/29/34/36, and iOS built under **both** CocoaPods and
SwiftPM. Release is tag-only; publishing to pub.dev is manual.

```

`bin/` tools are declared as `executables:` in `pubspec.yaml` and run via `dart run locus:<tool>`.

## Architecture

Feature-first, dependencies point inward, outer layers never imported by inner ones:
host app → public barrel (`lib/locus.dart`) → feature modules → core → shared → native.

Native owns the long-lived process (Android `ForegroundService` + `HeadlessService`, iOS
background location delegates, persistent queue, geofence registration, activity recognition) and
emits typed events that `lib/src/core/event_mapper.dart` translates for Dart.

- **Platform Interface pattern** — `LocusInterface` + `MethodChannelLocus` let host apps swap in
  `MockLocus` via `Locus.setInstance(...)` for their own tests.
- **Event-sourced state** — native is the source of truth. `Locus.isTracking()` calls the
  platform; Dart never caches tracking state.
- **Headless execution** — callbacks registered via `Locus.registerHeadlessTask` run in a second
  engine after the UI is killed, and every headless entry point needs `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`.
  See `doc/guides/headless-execution.md`.
- **Barrel exports per feature** — each feature exposes its surface through `<feature>.dart`.

Non-negotiables:

- A feature must **never** import another feature's `models/` or `services/` — route through
  `shared/` or an event stream.
- `lib/src/` must **never** use `dart:io` for platform detection — go through `LocusInterface`.
- `bin/` programs are pure Dart and must not import `package:flutter/*`.
- Native code must survive `onDetachedFromEngine`: the engine detaches whenever the UI is swiped
  away, and the background service has to keep running.
- `stopOnTerminate: false` + `enableHeadless: true` + `foregroundService: true` is the canonical
  always-on tracking configuration. Validate any lifecycle change against it (see issue #34).

## Gotchas

- **Minimal dependency surface is deliberate.** No Riverpod, no freezed, no code generation — all
  models are hand-written immutable data classes, which keeps install size and compile times down
  and keeps SDK opinions out of host apps. Do not add a runtime Dart dependency without explicit
  approval; each one becomes transitive for every consuming app.
- **`args` must stay in `dependencies:`,** not `dev_dependencies:`. Pub's `executables:` contract
  requires it so `dart run locus:setup` works for consumers.
- **`pubspec.yaml` is the single source of the version.** After bumping, run
  `dart run tool/sync_version.dart` to propagate into the Dart constants; Gradle and the podspec
  read the line directly at build time.
- **HTTP sync, queue/UUID generation, and OEM detection live in native code,** not Dart — reach
  them through `LocusChannels.methods` (`sync`, `getDiagnosticsMetadata`, …).
- **iOS ships under two module names** (`locus` and `Locus`); native tests run against both.
- `dart format` run directly may print package-resolution warnings; they are expected and the
  lints resolve correctly under `flutter analyze`.
